We are solving the CP problem usign MiniZinc for python. 
As specified in the official MiniZinc documentation, the program is expected to be installed in its default location, otherwise the environmental variable should be set.

We encountered some problems using the latest python version. From our testing the script works for versions 3.6 and 3.7.

The python modules required are: matplotlib,minizinc

The path for the different input/output operations are set to work for the current folder hierarchy.
